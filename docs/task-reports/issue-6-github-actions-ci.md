# Issue Report: [6] - Setup Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

## 1. Summary

Configured a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and tests the project on Linux and Windows.

## 2. Background

* **Context:** Continuous integration ensures that changes compile and all tests pass across supported platforms.
* **Related Tickets/Discussions:** Issue #6.

## 3. Objectives

* **Goal 1:** Automate build and test on push and pull request events.
* **Goal 2:** Support Linux and Windows runners for future expansion.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

* [x] Criterion 1: Workflow triggers on push and pull requests.
* [x] Criterion 2: Build and test steps run on Linux and Windows.

## 5. Implementation Details

1. **Approach:** Added a GitHub Actions workflow using matrix strategy to run `dev.sh` commands on both platforms.
2. **Files Changed:**
   * `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Defines build and test jobs.
   * `AGENTS.md`: Updated project structure list.
3. **Key Code Snippets:**

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
```

4. **Libraries/Tools Used:**
   * GitHub Actions (default runners)

## 6. Testing

* **Unit Tests:** Executed via workflow and locally with `./dev.sh test run`.
* **Integration Tests:** Workflow builds and tests on both operating systems.
* **Manual Verification Steps:**
  1. Run `bash ./dev.sh build release shared`.
  2. Run `bash ./dev.sh test run`.

## 7. Screenshots / Diagrams

N/A

## 8. Impact Assessment

* **Affected Components:** Build automation.
* **Performance Impact:** Minimal increase in CI time.
* **Security Considerations:** None.

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Workflow failure on new OS | Limit initial matrix to Linux and Windows and monitor runs |
| Build environment differences | Use bash shell on both runners |
