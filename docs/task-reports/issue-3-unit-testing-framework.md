# Issue Report: [3] - Establish Unit Testing Framework

## 1. Summary

Integrated Google Test via vcpkg and provided a sample test to validate the framework.

## 2. Background

* **Context:** Unit tests were required to ensure future development can be validated automatically.
* **Related Tickets/Discussions:** Issue #3.

## 3. Objectives

* **Goal 1:** Integrate Google Test using the existing vcpkg setup.
* **Goal 2:** Add a simple always-pass test to confirm Google Test works.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

* [x] Criterion 1: Google Test is installed via vcpkg and configured in CMake.
* [x] Criterion 2: A sample test executes successfully.

## 5. Implementation Details

1. **Approach:** Updated the build system to compile Google Test and added a trivial test file.
2. **Files Changed:**

   * `vcpkg.json`: lists `gtest` as a dependency.
   * `tests/sample_test.cpp`: new always-pass test.
   * `CMakeLists.txt`: includes the new test file when building `dummy_test`.
   * `README.md`: documented how to run tests.
   * `AGENTS.md`: project structure updated.
3. **Key Code Snippets:**

```cpp
TEST(SampleTest, AlwaysPasses) {
    EXPECT_TRUE(true);
}
```

4. **Libraries/Tools Used:**

   * Google Test (via vcpkg)

## 6. Testing

* **Unit Tests:** Executed with `./dev.sh test run`.
* **Integration Tests:** N/A.
* **Manual Verification Steps:**

  1. Build the project using `./dev.sh build debug`.
  2. Run tests with `./dev.sh test run`.

## 7. Screenshots / Diagrams

N/A

## 8. Impact Assessment

* **Affected Components:** Build system, tests, documentation.
* **Performance Impact:** Negligible.
* **Security Considerations:** None.

## 9. Risks & Mitigations
